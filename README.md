### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
**Wins**
1. The project was completed ahead of schedule, which gives me time to individualize my program.
2. I've grown so much these last 3 weeks, and I feel confident in foundational JS.<br>

**Challenges**
1. Building out the DOM was daunting, but taking it a step at a time helped ease my tension.
2. As I started to implement CSS properties, I needed to restructure the DOM in order to make elements interact with each other the way I wanted them to.
